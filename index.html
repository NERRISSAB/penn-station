        <h2>Construction Summary</h2>
        <p>Pennsylvania Station was a well-appraised Beaux-Arts railroad station designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White. It was built on two full city blocks extending from 31st to 33rd Streets, between 7th and 8th Avenues. The design
          of the waiting room was inspired by the Ancient Roman Baths at Carace. The room was a copy of the baths increased in size by twenty percent.</p>

        <h2>Destruction Summary</h2>
        <p>In response to a decrease in train travel and an incease in maintenance and real estate costs, Pennsyvania Railroad opted to sell the station's air rights. Despite protests the railroad demolished the station and built Madison Square Garden as
          part of The Penn Station Entertainment and Business center. The destruction of Penn Station gave rise to a national preservation movement. The New York City Landmarks Commmission was created less than a year later and is credited with preventing
          the destruction of Grand Central Terminal and hundreds of other significant New York structures. </p>

        <p>Penn Station is now completely underground below Madison Square Garden and Two Penn Plaza with three underground levels. Former Senator Moynihan advocated a new Penn Station in the adjacent post office building also designed by Mckim, Mead & White.
          Construction has begun.>
